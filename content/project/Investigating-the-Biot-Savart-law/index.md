In this experiment we look at how the Biot savart law predicts the magnetic field strength in and around different current carrying objects, and different orientations, distances, currents and lengths of objects, we discover that as we keep all other variables constant and changing one variable the Biot savart law continues to predict to a fairly accurate degree how the magnetic field strength changes with that variable, with most errors calculated for out experimental results being within 6% of the calculated theoretical value, we can say that our experimental methods are indeed reliable and with certainty we can also state that the Biot savart law accurately describe the reality of how magnetic fields change relative to a certain variable for many different geometries of current carrying objects
